# P2-Mushroom-monitoring-system

This code is the software component of a device that monitors the vital parameters of mushrooms during their growth: soil and air humidity, as well as temperature. The code is written for the Atmega 164A microcontroller, compiled and built in AVR CodeVision version 4.03.
Part of the code is auto-generated by CodeVision, and the integration code for the DHT-11 sensor is taken from here: https://github.com/efthymios-ks/AVR-DHT.
